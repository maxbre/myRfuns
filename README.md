# myRfuns

A collection of my handy R functions.

Starting almost from scratch I decided jot down some R functions it happens I use quite often.

Beware: all the material must be considered experimental, in full development, not yet tested.

Caveat emptor: use it at your own risk.

To install the package:

library(devtools)

install_github("maxbre/myRfuns")
