# myRfuns

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A collection of my handy R functions.

Starting almost from scratch I decided to jot down some R functions it
happens I use quite often.

Beware: all the material must be considered experimental, in full
development, not yet tested.

Caveat emptor: use it at your own risk.

## Installation

You can install the development version of myRfuns from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maxbre/myRfuns")
```
